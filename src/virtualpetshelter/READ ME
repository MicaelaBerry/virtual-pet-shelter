READ ME for Virtual Pet Shelter

Welcome to the Queen Anne's Revenge Pet Shelter. While you are here please feel 
free to look around and interact with our pets! Here are some things you can do...

- Feed our pets some stinky pirate grub.
- Give water to our pets.
- Go pillaging with our pets. You can also pick a particular one to sail the 7 seas with!
- Adopt a pet (which we hope you do). Pick your favorite pet!
- Giving us a stowaway. We always accommodate stowaways. How else do you think this place stays clean?!

Have fun at the Queen Anne's Revenge Pet Shelter!
